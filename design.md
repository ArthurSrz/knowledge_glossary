A **design** is the concept of or proposal for an object, process, or [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System "System"). The word _design_ refers to something that is or has been intentionally created by a thinking agent, and is sometimes used to refer to the inherent nature of something – its design. The verb _to design_ expresses the process of developing a design. In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan may also be considered to be a design (such as in arts and crafts). A design is expected to have a purpose within a specific context, typically aiming to satisfy certain [goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal "Goal") and constraints while taking into account [aesthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics "Aesthetics"), functional and experiential considerations. Traditional examples of designs include [architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_drawing "Architectural drawing") and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_drawing "Engineering drawing") drawings, [circuit diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_diagram "Circuit diagram"), [sewing patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_\(sewing\) "Pattern (sewing)"), and less tangible artefacts such as [business process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process "Business process") models.[1](app://obsidian.md/1)(#cite_note-:1-1)[2](app://obsidian.md/2)(#cite_note-2)
