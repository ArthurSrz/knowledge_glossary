It addresses concerns about bias, fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI development. Organizations must ensure their AI systems are designed with ethical considerations from the outset. Key principles include avoiding harm, ensuring fairness across different groups, maintaining transparency in decision-making processes, and implementing robust governance frameworks.""",

This occurs when training data contains historical inequalities or when algorithms amplify existing societal biases. Examples include facial recognition systems that perform poorly on darker skin tones, or hiring algorithms that discriminate against women. Organizations must implement bias detection tools, use diverse training datasets, and conduct regular fairness audits.""",

Poor data quality can significantly impact model performance and lead to erroneous conclusions. Key dimensions include accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, and validity. Companies should invest 60-80% of their time in data cleaning and validation processes before model training.""",

This includes implementing data minimization principles, obtaining proper consent, and using privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy and federated learning. Organizations must comply with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.""",

However, performance should not be evaluated solely on technical metrics but also consider fairness, robustness, and real-world impact. Organizations should establish baseline performance thresholds and monitor models continuously in production."""
