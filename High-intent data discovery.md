> A data scientist with high-intent has a specific set of goals and can likely articulate exactly what they’re looking for. This mode of discovery is often more important to more tenured data scientists who may be familiar with some datasets, but may be looking for something they haven’t used before that meets a certain set of criteria. For example, as a data scientist with high-intent, I may want to:  find a dataset by its name, find a dataset that contains a specific schema field, find a dataset related to a particular topic, find a relevant dataset located in a particular BigQuery project, find a dataset that my colleague has used of which I can’t remember the name, and/or find the top datasets that a team has used because I’m collaborating on a new project with them.
