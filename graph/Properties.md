# Properties

## Definition

Properties are characteristics or attributes that belong to or describe substances, first systematically analyzed by Aristotle in his "Metaphysics" and "Categories" (4th century BCE), distinguishing between essential and accidental properties.

## Historical Development

1. **Aristotle's Framework (4th century BCE)**: Distinction between substance and properties
2. **Medieval Scholasticism**: Refinement of property theory
3. **Modern Philosophy**: Locke's primary/secondary qualities
4. **Contemporary Metaphysics**: Property theory and trope theory

## Aristotle's Original Concepts

According to Aristotle's "Metaphysics":
- Properties (attributes) exist in substances
- Essential properties define what a thing is
- Accidental properties can change without changing identity
- Properties cannot exist independently of substances
- Categories of properties: quality, quantity, relation, etc.

## Types of Properties

1. **Essential Properties**:
   - Define the nature of a thing
   - Cannot be removed without destroying identity
   - Example: Rationality in humans

2. **Accidental Properties**:
   - Can change without affecting identity
   - Not necessary for the thing's existence
   - Example: Color of an object

3. **Relational Properties**:
   - Exist only in relation to other things
   - Example: Being taller than

4. **Dispositional Properties**:
   - Tendencies or potentials
   - Example: Fragility, solubility

## Philosophical Perspectives

1. **Realism**:
   - Properties exist independently
   - Universal properties shared by particulars

2. **Nominalism**:
   - Only particular things exist
   - Properties are mental constructs

3. **Trope Theory**:
   - Properties are particular instances
   - Each property is unique to its bearer

## Modern Classification

1. **Intrinsic Properties**:
   - Belong to object independently
   - Not dependent on external factors

2. **Extrinsic Properties**:
   - Depend on relations to other things
   - Example: Weight (depends on gravity)

3. **Primary Properties**:
   - Measurable, objective qualities
   - Example: Size, shape

4. **Secondary Properties**:
   - Subjective, perceptual qualities
   - Example: Color, taste

## Scientific Understanding

1. **Physical Properties**:
   - Mass, charge, spin
   - Observable and measurable

2. **Chemical Properties**:
   - Reactivity, oxidation state
   - Behavior in reactions

3. **Emergent Properties**:
   - Arise from complex systems
   - Not reducible to parts

## Logical Framework

1. **Predication**:
   - Attribution of properties to subjects
   - "S is P" (Subject has Property)

2. **Instantiation**:
   - Objects exemplify properties
   - Multiple instantiation possible

3. **Property Relations**:
   - Compatibility
   - Exclusion
   - Implication

## Applications

1. **Ontology**:
   - Nature of existence
   - Categories of being

2. **Logic**:
   - Predicate logic
   - Property theory

3. **Science**:
   - Classification systems
   - Experimental design

4. **Computer Science**:
   - Object-oriented programming
   - Database design

## Scientific Impact

Aristotle's work:
- Founded systematic metaphysics
- Established logical categories
- Influenced scientific classification
- Shaped Western philosophical thought

## Contemporary Issues

1. **Property Dualism**: Mental vs. physical properties
2. **Natural Kinds**: Essential properties in nature
3. **Supervenience**: Higher-level properties
4. **Property Identity**: When are properties the same?
