Iron law of oligarchy states that all complex organizations, regardless of how democratic they are when started, eventually develop into oligarchies. Michels observed that since no sufficiently large and complex organization can function purely as a [direct democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy "Direct democracy"), [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_\(social_and_political\) "Power (social and political)") within an organization will always get delegated to individuals within that group, elected or otherwise. As he put it in _Political Parties_, "It is organization which gives dominion of the elected over the electors. [...] Who says organization, says oligarchy."[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_oligarchy#cite_note-2)
