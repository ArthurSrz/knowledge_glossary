# Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to a specific task by continuing training on task-specific data.

## Original Definition

From Yosinski et al. (2014):
"Fine-tuning works as follows: first, we train a base network on a base dataset and task, and then we repurpose the learned features, or transfer them, to a second target network to be trained on a target dataset and task. This process tends to work if the features are general, meaning suitable for both base and target tasks."

From Devlin et al. (2019) on BERT:
"BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations... As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks."

## Historical Development

1. **Computer Vision (2012+)**: Fine-tuning CNN features
2. **Word Embeddings (2013+)**: Fine-tuning word vectors
3. **ULMFiT (2018)**: Systematic approach for NLP
4. **BERT Era (2019+)**: Standard practice for transformers
5. **Parameter-Efficient (2020+)**: Optimizing fine-tuning

## Fine-tuning Process

Basic algorithm:
1. Load pre-trained model weights
2. Replace/add task-specific layers
3. Continue training on task data
4. Optionally freeze certain layers

## Techniques

### Full Fine-tuning
From Devlin et al.:
"The simplest approach is to initialize all parameters with the pre-trained values and train all parameters end-to-end on the downstream task."

### Layer Freezing
From Yosinski et al.:
"We can freeze the bottom n layers of the network and only fine-tune the top layers. This preserves the general features learned in the bottom layers."

### Learning Rate Scheduling
From Howard & Ruder (2018):
"Discriminative fine-tuning: using different learning rates for different layers, typically decreasing from top to bottom layers."

## Parameter-Efficient Methods

### Adapter Modules (Houlsby et al., 2019)
"Adapters are small bottleneck layers inserted between layers of a pre-trained network. Only these adapter parameters are trained during fine-tuning."

### LoRA (Hu et al., 2021)
"Low-Rank Adaptation freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer."

## Mathematical Formulation

Standard fine-tuning:
θ_ft = argmin_θ L_task(f_θ(x), y) + λR(θ - θ_pre)

Where:
- θ_pre are pre-trained parameters
- θ_ft are fine-tuned parameters
- L_task is task-specific loss
- R is regularization term

## Benefits

From empirical research:
1. **Sample Efficiency**: Better performance with less data
2. **Faster Convergence**: Builds on learned features
3. **Better Generalization**: Leverages pre-trained knowledge
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Reduces computational needs

## Challenges

1. **Catastrophic Forgetting**: Losing pre-trained knowledge
2. **Negative Transfer**: When pre-training hurts performance
3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Learning rates, freezing strategies
4. **Task Mismatch**: Large domain gaps

## Best Practices

From ULMFiT (Howard & Ruder):
1. **Gradual Unfreezing**: Progressively unfreeze layers
2. **Discriminative Learning Rates**: Different rates per layer
3. **Slanted Triangular Learning Rates**: Warm-up then decay

## Applications

1. **Computer Vision**: Object detection, segmentation
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Text classification, QA
3. **Speech Recognition**: Accent adaptation
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Policy transfer

## Historical Significance

Fine-tuning:
- Enabled practical transfer learning
- Made large models accessible
- Democratized AI development
- Changed the training paradigm

As Yosinski noted: "Fine-tuning can give significant performance boosts, especially when the target dataset is small."

## Modern Developments

1. **Prompt Tuning**: Only tune prompt embeddings
2. **Prefix Tuning**: Add trainable prefixes
3. **Multi-task Fine-tuning**: Simultaneous task adaptation
4. **Continual Fine-tuning**: Sequential task learning
5. **Few-shot Fine-tuning**: Adaptation with minimal data

The evolution continues toward more efficient and effective methods for adapting large pre-trained models.
