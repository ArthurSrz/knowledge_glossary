## Definition

Systems theory is the transdisciplinary study of systems as cohesive groups of interrelated, interdependent components that can be natural or artificial, first formalized by Ludwig von Bertalanffy in his General System Theory.

## Historical Development

1. **Initial Formulation (1950)**: Ludwig von Bertalanffy published "An Outline of General System Theory" in the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, establishing the formal foundations.

2. **Formal Publication (1968)**: "General System Theory: Foundations, Development, Applications" consolidated his work into a comprehensive framework.

## Key Principles

According to von Bertalanffy (1950):
- Systems are "complexes of elements standing in interaction"
- An interdisciplinary approach is necessary to understand systems
- Systems exhibit properties that cannot be derived from their individual components (emergence)
- Open systems exchange matter and energy with their environment

## Fundamental Concepts

1. **Holism**: The system is more than the sum of its parts
2. **Boundaries**: Systems have identifiable boundaries separating them from their environment
3. **Feedback**: Systems contain feedback loops that regulate behavior
4. **Equifinality**: Open systems can reach the same final state from different initial conditions
5. **Homeostasis**: Systems maintain stability through self-regulation

## Scientific Impact

Systems theory provided:
- A unified framework for understanding complex phenomena across disciplines
- The foundation for cybernetics and complexity science
- Tools for analyzing social, biological, and technological systems
- A bridge between natural and social sciences

## Core Characteristics

- Wholeness and interdependence
- Goal-seeking behavior
- Transformation processes
- Inputs and outputs
- Hierarchy and organization
- Self-regulation and control
