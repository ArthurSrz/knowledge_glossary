# Regression

## Definition

Regression is a statistical method for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, originally discovered by Francis Galton in studying hereditary patterns.

## Historical Development

1. **Initial Discovery (1885-1886)**: Sir Francis Galton discovered regression while studying sweet peas and human height inheritance

2. **Landmark Paper (1886)**: "Regression Towards Mediocrity in Hereditary Stature" published in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute

3. **Term Evolution**: Initially called "regression toward mediocrity," later became "regression toward the mean"

## Galton's Original Concept

According to Galton (1886):
- Offspring characteristics tend to move toward the population mean
- "The average regression of the offspring is a constant fraction of their respective mid-parental deviations"
- Discovered while measuring heights of parents and children
- Found that tall parents tend to have children shorter than themselves (but still above average)

## Key Principles

1. **Regression to the Mean**: Extreme observations tend to be followed by more moderate ones
2. **Linear Relationship**: Variables are related through a linear function
3. **Error Term**: Accounts for unexplained variation
4. **Prediction**: Uses known values to estimate unknown values
5. **Causality vs Correlation**: Regression identifies relationships, not necessarily causation

## Types of Regression

1. **Simple Linear Regression**: One independent variable
   - Y = β₀ + β₁X + ε

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**: Multiple independent variables
   - Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + βₙXₙ + ε

3. **Polynomial Regression**: Non-linear relationships
4. **Logistic Regression**: Binary outcomes
5. **Ridge and Lasso Regression**: Regularized methods

## Modern Applications

- Economics: Forecasting economic indicators
- Biology: Modeling growth patterns
- Medicine: Predicting disease outcomes
- Social Sciences: Understanding social phenomena
- Machine Learning: Predictive modeling

## Key Concepts

1. **Least Squares Method**: Minimizing sum of squared errors
2. **Coefficient of Determination (R²)**: Proportion of variance explained
3. **Residual Analysis**: Examining prediction errors
4. **Model Assumptions**: Linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality

## Scientific Impact

Galton's work:
- Founded modern statistical regression analysis
- Led to development of correlation coefficient (by Karl Pearson)
- Established basis for predictive modeling
- Influenced fields from genetics to economics
