# Sensitive Information

## Definition

Sensitive information is data that requires protection from unauthorized access to safeguard the privacy or security of an individual or organization, a concept legally established by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis in "The Right to Privacy" (1890).

## Historical Development

1. **Warren & Brandeis Paper (1890)**: Legal foundation for privacy rights
2. **Fair Information Practices (1973)**: HEW Report principles
3. **OECD Privacy Guidelines (1980)**: International standards
4. **EU Data Protection Directive (1995)**: Comprehensive privacy law
5. **GDPR (2018)**: Modern data protection standard

## Warren & Brandeis's Original Concept

In their 1890 Harvard Law Review article:
- Established "the right to be let alone"
- Recognized intangible property rights in personal information
- Addressed threats from new technologies (photography, newspapers)
- Created legal framework for privacy protection
- Distinguished between public and private matters

## Categories of Sensitive Information

   - Name, address, phone number
   - Social Security numbers
   - Identification numbers
   - Biometric data

2. **Financial Information**:
   - Bank account details
   - Credit card numbers
   - Income information

## Protection Principles

1. **Collection Limitation**: Minimize data gathering
2. **Purpose Specification**: Clear usage intent
3. **Use Limitation**: Restrict to stated purposes
4. **Security Safeguards**: Technical and organizational measures
5. **Openness**: Transparency about practices
6. **Individual Participation**: Access and correction rights
7. **Accountability**: Responsibility for compliance

## Security Measures
