- Implement [[ML models]] at scale
- Create and maintain ML pipelines
- Deploy models to cloud/edge environments

#### System Architecture
- Design scalable ML infrastructure
- Optimize model performance and efficiency
- Implement monitoring and logging systems
- Ensure system reliability and fault tolerance

#### DevOps & MLOps
- Automate model training and deployment
- Implement CI/CD for ML workflows
- Version control for code, data, and models
- Monitor model performance in production

## Required Skills
