Forest made of trees, each of them being an independent model trained on datasets created using [[Bootstrap aggregating (bagging)]]

> When a random forest is asked to classify a new point, the random forest gives that point to each of the decision trees. Each of those trees reports their classification and the random forest returns the most popular classification. Itâ€™s like every tree gets a vote, and the most popular classification wins.
