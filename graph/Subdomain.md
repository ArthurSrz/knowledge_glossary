A subdomain is a fine-grained area of business activity. All of a companyâ€™s subdomains form its business domain: the service it provides to its customers.

> Starbucks may be most recognized for its coffee, but building a successful coffeehouse chain requires more than just knowing how to make great coffee. You also have to buy or rent real estate at effective locations, hire personnel, and manage finances, among other activities.
