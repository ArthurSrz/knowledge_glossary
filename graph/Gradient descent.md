Iterative method to find the value of the weights that minimize the cost function. It is made possible by : 
* [[Learning rate]] that tells you how far to move on the gradient descent curve
* [[Gradient]] that tells you where direction to go 
* Iterations that tell you how many times you should move toward that direction.
