# Train Loss

## Definition

Train loss is a quantitative measure of the difference between predicted and actual values during model training, formalized by Bernard Widrow and Marcian Hoff in 1960 through the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm and the delta rule.

## Historical Development

1. **Widrow-Hoff Algorithm (1960)**: LMS and adaptive error minimization
2. **ADALINE**: Adaptive Linear Neuron with error-based learning
3. **Backpropagation (1986)**: Extension to multilayer networks
4. **Modern Deep Learning**: Various loss functions for different tasks

## Widrow & Hoff's Original Concept

According to Widrow & Hoff (1960):
- Error as the difference between desired and actual output
- Squared error minimization (LMS algorithm)
- Gradient descent for weight adjustment
- Adaptive systems that learn from mistakes
- Real-time error correction

## Mathematical Formulation

1. **Basic Error**:
   - e = y - ŷ
   - y: actual value
   - ŷ: predicted value

2. **Squared Error**:
   - L = (y - ŷ)²
   - Penalizes larger errors more

3. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:
   - L = 1/n Σ(y - ŷ)²
   - Average over all samples

4. **Weight Update Rule**:
   - w(t+1) = w(t) - η∇L
   - η: learning rate
   - ∇L: gradient of loss

## Types of Loss Functions

1. **Regression Losses**:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Huber Loss
   - Log-Cosh Loss

2. **Classification Losses**:
   - Cross-Entropy
   - Hinge Loss
   - Focal Loss
   - KL Divergence

3. **Specialized Losses**:
   - Triplet Loss
   - Contrastive Loss
   - Wasserstein Loss
   - Perceptual Loss

## Key Properties

1. **Differentiability**:
   - Enables gradient computation
   - Necessary for backpropagation
