# LLM-as-Judges

## Definition

LLM-as-Judges is an evaluation methodology where large language models are used to assess the quality of outputs from other language models, introduced by Lianmin Zheng et al. in their 2023 paper "Judging LLM-as-a-Judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena."

## Historical Development

1. **Human Evaluation Tradition**: Manual assessment of AI outputs
2. **Automated Metrics Era**: BLEU, ROUGE, perplexity
3. **LLM-as-Judge Concept (2023)**: Zheng et al.'s systematic approach
4. **MT-Bench Introduction**: Multi-turn evaluation framework
5. **Chatbot Arena**: Crowdsourced preference collection

## Zheng et al.'s Original Framework

According to Zheng et al. (2023):
- Strong LLMs can evaluate other models' outputs
- Judge models can match human preferences with 80%+ accuracy
- Scalable and explainable evaluation method
- Addresses limitations of traditional benchmarks
- Enables evaluation of open-ended questions

## Key Components

1. **Judge Models**:
   - Strong LLMs (e.g., GPT-4)
   - Multiple judge agreement checks
   - Position bias mitigation
   - Temperature control

2. **Evaluation Protocols**:
   - Pairwise comparison
   - Single-answer grading
   - Reference-based scoring
   - Multi-turn assessment

3. **MT-Bench**:
   - Multi-turn conversation evaluation
   - Eight categories of questions
   - Follow-up questions
   - Systematic scoring

4. **Chatbot Arena**:
   - Anonymous model comparison
   - Crowdsourced preferences
   - Real-world conversations
   - Battle-style ranking

## Methodology
