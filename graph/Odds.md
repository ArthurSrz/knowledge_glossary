# Odds

## Definition

Odds are a numerical expression of the likelihood of an event occurring relative to it not occurring, first formalized mathematically by Girolamo Cardano in "Liber de Ludo Aleae" (c. 1564, published 1663).

## Historical Development

1. **Cardano's Framework (c. 1564)**: First systematic treatment of probability in gambling
2. **Pascal-Fermat Correspondence (1654)**: Further development of probability theory
3. **Bayesian Statistics (1763)**: Application to inference
4. **Modern Probability Theory**: Formalization with measure theory

## Cardano's Original Concept

In "Liber de Ludo Aleae", Cardano established:
- Mathematical treatment of chance events
- Concept of equally likely outcomes
- Ratio of favorable to unfavorable outcomes
- Practical calculations for gambling odds
- Distinction between odds and probability

## Mathematical Definition

1. **Odds in favor**: 
   - Ratio of favorable to unfavorable outcomes
   - Odds = P(event) / P(not event) = p / (1-p)

2. **Odds against**:
   - Ratio of unfavorable to favorable outcomes
   - Odds against = (1-p) / p

3. **Probability from odds**:
   - P = odds / (1 + odds)

## Types of Odds

1. **Fractional Odds**:
   - Traditional gambling format
   - Example: 3/1 (three to one)
   - Profit/stake ratio

2. **Decimal Odds**:
   - Total return including stake
   - Example: 4.0 (returns 4 units for 1 staked)
   - Popular in Europe

3. **Moneyline/American Odds**:
   - Positive for underdogs (+300)
   - Negative for favorites (-150)
   - Based on $100 units

## Key Properties

1. **Reciprocal Relationship**:
   - Odds for = 1 / (Odds against)
   - P(A) = 1 - P(not A)

2. **Multiplicative Nature**:
   - Odds ratio = Odds₁ / Odds₂
   - Used in statistical analysis

3. **Logarithmic Scale**:
   - Log odds (logit) = ln(p/(1-p))
   - Linear in logistic regression

## Applications

1. **Gambling**:
   - Sports betting
   - Casino games
   - Horse racing

2. **Statistics**:
   - Logistic regression
   - Medical diagnosis
   - Risk assessment

3. **Decision Theory**:
   - Bayesian inference
   - Expected value calculations
   - Risk management

## Relationship to Probability

Conversion formulas:
- Probability = Odds / (1 + Odds)
- Odds = Probability / (1 - Probability)
- Odds ratio = (p₁/(1-p₁)) / (p₂/(1-p₂))

## Cognitive Aspects

1. **Intuitive Understanding**:
   - More natural for rare events
   - Better for comparing relative likelihood

2. **Common Misconceptions**:
   - Confusion with probability
   - Misinterpretation of odds ratios

## Scientific Impact

Cardano's work:
- Founded mathematical probability theory
- Enabled quantitative risk analysis
- Influenced development of statistics
- Essential for actuarial science

## Modern Extensions

1. **Bayesian Odds**:
   - Prior and posterior odds
   - Bayes factor

2. **Odds Ratio**:
   - Measure of association
   - Epidemiological studies

3. **Conditional Odds**:
   - Given specific information
   - Sequential updating
