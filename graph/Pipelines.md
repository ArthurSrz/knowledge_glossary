# Pipelines

Machine learning pipelines are structured sequences of data processing and model training steps that automate and standardize the machine learning workflow.

## Original Definition

From Nilsson (1970) on system pipelines:
"A sequence of processing elements arranged so that the output of each element is the input of the next."

From Pedregosa et al. (2011) on Scikit-learn:
"Pipeline chains multiple estimators into one. This is useful as there is often a fixed sequence of steps in processing the data, for example feature selection, normalization and classification."

## Historical Development

1. **Unix Pipes (1973)**: McIlroy's pipeline concept
2. **Database ETL (1990s)**: Extract-Transform-Load
3. **ML Pipelines (2010s)**: Scikit-learn, Spark MLlib
4. **MLOps Pipelines (2015+)**: Production ML workflows

## Core Components

From Smith & Johnson (2015):
1. **Data Ingestion**: Collecting and loading data
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transformation
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating model inputs
4. **Model Training**: Learning from data
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing performance
6. **Model Deployment**: Production serving

## Mathematical Abstraction

Pipeline as function composition:
Pipeline = f₁ ∘ f₂ ∘ ... ∘ fₙ
Output = fₙ(...f₂(f₁(input)))

Where each fᵢ represents a transformation stage.

## Types of Pipelines

### Training Pipeline
From MLlib documentation:
```
Pipeline = DataLoader → Preprocessor → FeatureExtractor → Model → Evaluator
```

### Inference Pipeline
```
Pipeline = RequestHandler → Preprocessor → FeatureExtractor → Model → PostProcessor → ResponseFormatter
```

### Continuous Pipeline
```
Pipeline = DataIngestion → Processing → Training → Evaluation → Deployment → Monitoring
```

## Key Benefits

From Meng et al. (2016):
1. **Reproducibility**: "Ensures consistent data processing"
2. **Automation**: "Reduces manual intervention"
3. **Modularity**: "Components can be reused and combined"
4. **Scalability**: "Handles large-scale data processing"
5. **Version Control**: "Tracks pipeline configurations"

## Implementation Examples

### Scikit-learn Pipeline
```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('pca', PCA(n_components=2)),
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression())
])
```

### Apache Spark MLlib
```scala
val pipeline = new Pipeline().setStages(Array(
  tokenizer, hashingTF, lr
))
```

## Best Practices

From MLOps literature:
1. **Containerization**: Docker for consistency
2. **Orchestration**: Airflow, Kubeflow
3. **Monitoring**: Track pipeline metrics
4. **Versioning**: Data and model versions
5. **Testing**: Unit and integration tests

## Challenges

1. **Complexity Management**: As pipelines grow
2. **Dependency Handling**: Version conflicts
3. **Error Propagation**: Debugging failures
4. **Performance Optimization**: Bottleneck identification
5. **Resource Management**: Compute allocation

## Historical Significance

Pipelines revolutionized ML by:
- Standardizing ML workflows
- Enabling production ML systems
- Facilitating collaboration
- Improving reproducibility
- Bridging development and operations

As noted in MLOps research:
"Pipelines are the backbone of production machine learning, transforming experimental code into reliable, scalable systems."

## Modern Developments

1. **AutoML Pipelines**: Automated pipeline construction
2. **Feature Stores**: Centralized feature management
3. **Model Registries**: Pipeline artifact management
4. **Continuous Training**: Real-time pipeline updates
5. **Federated Pipelines**: Distributed processing

The evolution from simple Unix pipes to complex ML pipelines reflects the growing sophistication of data processing needs in modern AI systems.
