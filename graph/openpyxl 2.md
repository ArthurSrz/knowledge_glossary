## Features Lost on Round-Trip Through openpyxl

| [[Feature]] | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Shapes (images, drawings) | Dropped on open/save |
| Slicers | Stripped |
| VBA [[macros]] | Silently wiped (use `keep_vba=True` + `.xlsm` to preserve) |
| Sparklines | No support — lost |
| Threaded comments | No support — likely dropped |
| Comment formatting and dimensions | Lost; comments not supported in `read_only` mode |
| Charts across sheets | May raise exceptions |
| Conditional formatting | Cannot validate [[rules]]; not supported in `write_only` mode |
| `.xls` format | Not supported (use `xlrd`) |
| `.xlsb` format | Not supported |

### Practical Impact

Any [[bijectivity]] tool using openpyxl inherits these limitations. Features that openpyxl drops are invisible to the sync pipeline — they can't be detected, preserved, or audited.

### gspread Limitations

The popular `gspread` [[Python]] wrapper adds convenience but:

- Does not handle formatting sync at all
- No support for merges, [[data]] validation, or conditional formatting
- Limited batch operation support
- Rate limiting must be handled manually
