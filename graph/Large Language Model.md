# Large Language Model (LLM)

A Large Language Model is a type of neural network model specifically designed to process and generate human language. These models are characterized by their massive scale, with billions of parameters, and their ability to understand context and produce human-like text.

## Key Characteristics

### Scale
- Contains billions (sometimes trillions) of parameters
- Trained on vast text corpora from diverse sources
- Requires significant computational resources (GPUs/TPUs)

### Architecture
- Based on transformer architecture (introduced in "Attention Is All You Need" paper, 2017)
- Uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequences
- Can be:
  - Encoder-only (e.g., [[BERT]])
  - Decoder-only (e.g., [[GPT2]], GPT-3)
  - Encoder-decoder (e.g., T5, BART)

### Capabilities
- Natural language understanding and generation
- Few-shot and zero-shot learning
- Task adaptation without fine-tuning
- Contextual understanding across long sequences

## Training Process

1. **Pre-training**: Learning general language patterns from massive unlabeled text data
2. **Fine-tuning**: Adaptation to specific tasks with labeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Alignment with human preferences

## Applications

- Text generation and completion
- Translation
- Summarization
- Question answering
- Code generation
- Content moderation
- Conversational AI

## Challenges

- **Computational cost**: Expensive to train and deploy
- **Hallucination**: Generation of factually incorrect information
- **Bias and fairness**: Reproducing societal biases from training data
- **Safety and alignment**: Ensuring outputs align with human values
- **Environmental impact**: High energy consumption

## Notable Examples

- GPT (OpenAI)
- BERT (Google)
- LLaMA (Meta)
- PaLM (Google)
- Claude (Anthropic)
