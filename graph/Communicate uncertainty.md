Aside from [[Don Norman's principles of Interaction Design]], this is a specific consideration to take into account when designing [[ML system]]. 

Whether you display a deterministic or probabilistic [[Output]] depends on the value of the probabilistic information for the decision-making or the user. 

## Uncertainty in [[Classification]]

**Seeing probabilities may cause different decision-making**. We can also provide the **basis for prediction** to explain why the model chose which class. 

## Uncertainty in [[regression]]

* We can provide a confidence interval (95% interval the bus will arrive between 6 and 22 minutes instead of "the bus will arrive in 12 minutes")
* We can also expose a prediction interval : how likely is the prediction to be within a certain range 

There is a tradeoff between [[Precision]] and ease of interpretation [[Interpretability]]
