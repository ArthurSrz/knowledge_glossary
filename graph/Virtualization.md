[Virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization): In computing, virtualization is a series of technologies that allows dividing of physical computing resources into a series of virtual machines, operating systems, processes or containers.

In hardware virtualization, the host machine is the machine that is used by the virtualization and the guest machine is the virtual machine. The words host and guest are used to distinguish the software that runs on the physical machine from the software that runs on the virtual machine. 

Operating-system-level virtualization, also known as containerization, refers to an operating system feature in which the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances.

The usual goal of virtualization is to centralize administrative tasks while improving scalability and overall hardware-resource utilization.
