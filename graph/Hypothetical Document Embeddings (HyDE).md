Enter Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE), an innovative approach detailed in the paper titledÂ [_Precise Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval without Relevance Labels_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496). The core hypothesis of HyDE is simple yet profound: when conducting a document search, using hypothetical answers might yield superior results compared to using the question itself.
