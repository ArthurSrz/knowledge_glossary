# Decision Making

## Definition

Decision making is the cognitive process of selecting a course of action from among multiple alternatives, fundamentally revolutionized by Herbert A. Simon's theory of bounded rationality.

## Historical Development

1. **Traditional Rationality Theory (pre-1950s)**: Assumed complete information and perfect rationality in decision-making

2. **Landmark Paper (1955)**: Simon published "A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice" in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, introducing bounded rationality

3. **Administrative Behavior (1947)**: Simon's earlier work laid groundwork for understanding organizational decision-making

## Key Concepts

According to Simon (1955):
- Decision makers have limited computational capabilities
- Information is incomplete and costly to obtain
- People use satisficing rather than optimizing strategies
- Rationality is bounded by cognitive limitations

## Fundamental Principles

1. **Bounded Rationality**: Humans have limited cognitive resources for processing information

2. **Satisficing**: Decision makers seek satisfactory rather than optimal solutions

3. **Simplification**: Complex problems are reduced to manageable ones through heuristics

4. **Sequential Search**: Options are evaluated one at a time until a satisfactory one is found

## Essential Elements of Simon's Model

1. Set of behavioral alternatives
2. Subset of alternatives considered
3. Possible future states of affairs
4. Payoff function (assigning values to outcomes)
5. Information about the probability of outcomes

## Scientific Impact

Simon's work:
- Earned him the Nobel Prize in Economics (1978)
- Founded the field of behavioral economics
- Revolutionized organizational theory
- Influenced artificial intelligence research
- Changed understanding of human cognition

## Types of Decision Making

1. **Programmed Decisions**: Routine, repetitive decisions
2. **Non-programmed Decisions**: Novel, unstructured problems
3. **Strategic Decisions**: Long-term, organizational direction
4. **Tactical Decisions**: Medium-term implementation
5. **Operational Decisions**: Day-to-day activities
