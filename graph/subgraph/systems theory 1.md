**Systems theory** is the [transdisciplinary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdisciplinarity "Transdisciplinarity")[1](app://obsidian.md/1)(#cite_note-1) study of [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System "System"), i.e. cohesive groups of interrelated, interdependent components that can be [natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural "Natural") or [artificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial "Artificial"). Every system has causal boundaries, is influenced by its context, defined by its structure, function and role, and expressed through its relations with other systems. A system is "more than the sum of its parts" when it expresses [synergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy "Synergy") or [emergent behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_behavior "Emergent behavior").[2](app://obsidian.md/2)(#cite_note-2)

Changing one component of a system may affect other components or the whole system. It may be possible to predict these changes in patterns of behavior. For systems that learn and adapt, the growth and the degree of [adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation "Adaptation") depend upon how well the system is engaged with its environment and other contexts influencing its organization. Some systems support other systems, maintaining the other system to prevent failure. The goals of systems theory are to model a system's dynamics, [constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints "Theory of constraints"), conditions, and relations; and to elucidate principles (such as purpose, measure, methods, tools) that can be discerned and applied to other systems at every level of nesting, and in a wide range of fields for achieving optimized [equifinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equifinality "Equifinality").[3](app://obsidian.md/3)(#cite_note-3)

General systems theory is about developing broadly applicable concepts and principles, as opposed to concepts and principles specific to one domain of knowledge. It distinguishes dynamic or active systems from static or passive systems. Active systems are activity structures or components that interact in behaviours and processes or interrelate through formal contextual boundary conditions (attractors). Passive systems are structures and components that are being processed. For example, a computer program is passive when it is a file stored on the hard drive and active when it runs in memory.[4](app://obsidian.md/4)(#cite_note-4) The field is related to [systems thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking "Systems thinking"), machine logic, and [systems engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering "Systems engineering").
