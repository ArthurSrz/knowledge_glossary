Aside from [[Don Norman's principles of Interaction Design 1]], this is a specific consideration when designing [[ML system 1]]. Key considerations : 

* where does AI exists ? 
* what data it uses ? 
* how it reaches its output ? 

### How to provide transparency ? 

* Cite data sources and attributes 
* Give insight into importance of attributes
* Provide basis for model output : 
	* why did you do that ? 
	* why not something else ? 


We can use [[Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) 1]]  or [[Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) 1]], or just inform the user on the interface.
