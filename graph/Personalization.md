# Personalization

## Definition

Personalization is the adaptation of information, services, or products to individual user preferences and characteristics, formalized in computer science by Paul Resnick et al. with GroupLens (1994), introducing collaborative filtering for automated personalized recommendations.

## Historical Development

1. **Tapestry System (1992)**: Early collaborative filtering requiring user knowledge of each other
2. **GroupLens (1994)**: Resnick's automated collaborative filtering for Usenet news
3. **Amazon Recommendations (1998)**: Commercial implementation
4. **Netflix Prize (2006)**: Large-scale personalization challenge
5. **Deep Learning Era (2010s)**: Neural recommendation systems

## Resnick's Original Concept

According to Resnick et al. (1994):
- Collaborative filters help people make choices based on opinions of others
- Automated matching of users with similar interests
- No need for users to know each other personally
- Scalable personalization for large communities
- Distributed user ratings to personalize recommendations

## Key Principles

1. **User Modeling**:
   - Preference collection
   - Behavior tracking
   - Profile building
   - Implicit/explicit feedback

2. **Recommendation Algorithms**:
   - Collaborative filtering
   - Content-based filtering
   - Hybrid approaches
   - Context-aware systems

3. **Adaptation Mechanisms**:
   - Real-time updates
   - Dynamic content delivery
   - Interface customization
   - Experience tailoring

## Types of Personalization

1. **Content Personalization**:
   - News articles
   - Product recommendations
   - Media suggestions
   - Search results

2. **Interface Personalization**:
   - Layout adaptation
   - Feature prioritization
   - Navigation customization
   - Display preferences

3. **Service Personalization**:
   - Pricing models
   - Feature access
   - Communication channels
   - Support levels

4. **Experience Personalization**:
   - User journey mapping
   - Touchpoint optimization
   - Engagement timing
   - Interaction style

## Technical Approaches
