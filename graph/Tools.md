# Tools

## Definition

Tools are physical objects modified or created to extend human capabilities and accomplish specific tasks, a concept formalized in anthropology by Kenneth Oakley in "Man the Tool-Maker" (1949), building on Benjamin Franklin's earlier philosophical observation (1778).

## Historical Development

1. **Franklin's Definition (1778)**: "Man is a tool-making animal"
2. **Early Anthropology (19th century)**: Tool use as human distinction
3. **Oakley's Framework (1949)**: Comprehensive theory of tool-making
4. **Modern Archaeology**: Tool evolution and human development
5. **Cognitive Science**: Tools as cognitive extensions

## Key Theoretical Frameworks

### Franklin's Perspective (1778)
- Tool-making as defining human characteristic
- Link between tools and human progress
- Tools as manifestation of reason

### Oakley's Contributions (1949)
- Systematic classification of tools
- Evolution of tool-making techniques
- Relationship between tools and human evolution
- Cultural transmission of tool knowledge

## Types of Tools

1. **Simple Tools**:
   - Found objects used unmodified
   - Basic stone tools
   - Sticks and bones

2. **Compound Tools**:
   - Multiple components
   - Hafted implements
   - Combined materials

3. **Complex Tools**:
   - Mechanical advantage
   - Multiple moving parts
   - Precision instruments

4. **Power Tools**:
   - External energy sources
   - Mechanical assistance
   - Automated functions

## Tool Evolution Stages

1. **Oldowan (2.6 million years ago)**:
   - Basic choppers
   - Flaked stones
   - Core tools

2. **Acheulean (1.7 million years ago)**:
   - Hand axes
   - Symmetrical tools
   - Bifacial working

3. **Mousterian (300,000 years ago)**:
   - Prepared-core technique
   - Specialized tools
   - Composite tools

4. **Upper Paleolithic (50,000 years ago)**:
   - Blade technology
   - Bone and antler tools
   - Artistic elements

## Cognitive Aspects

1. **Tool Conception**:
   - Mental representation
   - Planning ability
   - Abstract thinking

2. **Tool Production**:
   - Manual dexterity
   - Sequence planning
   - Material knowledge

3. **Tool Use**:
   - Problem-solving
   - Skill acquisition
   - Cultural learning

## Cultural Significance

1. **Social Transmission**:
   - Teaching and learning
   - Cultural evolution
   - Technological traditions

2. **Economic Impact**:
   - Division of labor
   - Specialization
   - Trade networks

3. **Symbolic Value**:
   - Status indicators
   - Ritual objects
   - Cultural identity

## Modern Tool Theory

1. **Extended Mind Theory**:
   - Tools as cognitive extensions
   - Embodied cognition
   - Distributed intelligence

2. **Technological Determinism**:
   - Tools shape society
   - Cultural evolution
   - Technological momentum

3. **Human-Tool Interaction**:
   - Ergonomics
   - Interface design
   - User experience

## Applications

1. **Archaeology**:
   - Dating techniques
   - Cultural reconstruction
   - Migration patterns

2. **Industrial Design**:
   - Product development
   - User-centered design
   - Manufacturing processes
