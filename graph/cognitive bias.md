# Cognitive Bias

## Definition

Cognitive bias refers to systematic patterns of deviation from norm and/or rationality in judgment, introduced as a formal concept by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in their seminal works.

## Historical Development

1. **Initial Research (1972)**: Tversky and Kahneman introduced the notion of cognitive biases, which grew out of their observations of people's innumeracy and inability to reason intuitively with the greater orders of magnitude.

2. **Landmark Paper (1974)**: In "Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases," published in Science, they formally described three primary heuristics employed in making judgments under uncertainty:
   - Representativeness: Used when people judge the probability that an object or event A belongs to class or process B
   - Availability: Based on instances or scenarios that come to mind
   - Anchoring and adjustment: Starting from an initial value and adjusting to yield a final answer

## Key Concepts

According to Tversky and Kahneman (1974):
- Cognitive biases arise from the reliance on judgmental heuristics
- These biases are not random errors but systematic patterns
- They occur in predictable circumstances and affect expert judgment as well as lay decisions

## Fundamental Principles

The original framework established that:
1. Decision-making under uncertainty is not primarily a rational activity
2. People rely on a limited number of heuristic principles to reduce complex judgmental tasks to simpler ones
3. These heuristics are quite useful but sometimes lead to severe and systematic errors

## Scientific Impact

Tversky and Kahneman's work:
- Revolutionized the study of human rationality
- Had particular impact on economics and behavioral sciences
- Led to the development of behavioral economics
- Earned Kahneman the Nobel Prize in Economics (2002)
