# Graph Network Analysis

## Definition

Graph network analysis is the study of structures consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections) between them, founded when Leonhard Euler solved the Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem in 1736.

## Historical Development

1. **Original Problem (1736)**: Euler's solution to the Seven Bridges of Königsberg
   - Published as "Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis" in Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae

2. **Graph Theory Foundation**: Euler demonstrated that the problem was impossible, establishing the first theorem in graph theory

3. **Modern Development**: Evolved into network science with applications across disciplines

## Euler's Original Concept

Euler's key insights (1736):
- Abstracted the geography to points (nodes) and connections (edges)
- Demonstrated that for a path to traverse each edge exactly once:
  - All nodes except possibly two must have an even number of connections
  - At most two nodes can have an odd number of connections
- Created the concept of what is now called an "Eulerian path"

## Fundamental Concepts

1. **Graph Components**:
   - Vertices/Nodes: Entities in the network
   - Edges/Links: Connections between entities
   - Degree: Number of connections per node

2. **Graph Types**:
   - Directed vs. Undirected
   - Weighted vs. Unweighted
   - Connected vs. Disconnected
   - Cyclic vs. Acyclic

3. **Key Properties**:
   - Connectivity
   - Centrality
   - Clustering
   - Path lengths

## Core Metrics

1. **Degree Centrality**: Number of connections
2. **Betweenness Centrality**: Frequency on shortest paths
3. **Closeness Centrality**: Average distance to all nodes
4. **Eigenvector Centrality**: Importance based on neighbor importance
5. **Clustering Coefficient**: Local clustering tendency

## Modern Applications

1. **Social Networks**: Analyzing social connections
2. **Biological Networks**: Protein interactions, metabolic pathways
3. **Transportation**: Route optimization
4. **Computer Networks**: Internet topology
5. **Economics**: Trade relationships
6. **Neuroscience**: Brain connectivity

## Algorithms and Methods

1. **Traversal Algorithms**: BFS, DFS
2. **Shortest Path**: Dijkstra's, A*
3. **Community Detection**: Louvain, Girvan-Newman
4. **Network Flow**: Ford-Fulkerson
5. **PageRank**: Web page importance

## Scientific Impact

Euler's work:
- Created graph theory as a mathematical discipline
- Laid foundations for topology
- Enabled modern network science
- Influenced computer science and algorithms
- Essential for complex systems analysis

## Key Theories

1. **Small World Networks**: Six degrees of separation
2. **Scale-Free Networks**: Power law distribution
3. **Random Graphs**: Erdős–Rényi model
4. **Network Dynamics**: Evolution and resilience
5. **Multilayer Networks**: Interconnected systems
