# Network Graph

## Definition

A network graph is a mathematical structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections) that represent relationships between entities, with formal foundations in social network analysis established by Jacob L. Moreno in his 1934 work "Who Shall Survive?"

## Historical Development

1. **Moreno's Sociometry (1934)**: First systematic use of graphs for social relationships
2. **Graph Theory Integration (1950s)**: Mathematical formalization
3. **Computer Science Adoption (1960s)**: Data structure representation
4. **Network Science Emergence (1990s)**: Interdisciplinary field
5. **Social Network Era (2000s)**: Digital platforms and big data

## Moreno's Original Concept

According to Moreno (1934):
- Sociograms as visual representations of social relationships
- Mapping interpersonal connections in groups
- Quantifying social structures
- Revealing hidden patterns of influence
- Foundations of sociometry and network analysis

## Key Components

1. **Nodes (Vertices)**:
   - Represent entities
   - People, computers, concepts
   - Contain attributes
   - Unique identifiers

2. **Edges (Links)**:
   - Connect nodes
   - Directed or undirected
   - Weighted or unweighted
   - Multiple types possible

3. **Graph Properties**:
   - Density
   - Connectivity
   - Diameter
   - Clustering coefficient

## Types of Network Graphs

1. **Undirected Graphs**:
   - Symmetric relationships
   - Friendship networks
   - Collaboration graphs
   - Physical connections

2. **Directed Graphs**:
   - Asymmetric relationships
   - Citation networks
   - Web hyperlinks
   - Information flow

3. **Weighted Graphs**:
   - Edge values
   - Strength of connection
   - Traffic volumes
   - Distance metrics

4. **Multilayer Networks**:
   - Multiple relationship types
   - Different contexts
   - Temporal evolution
   - Cross-domain connections

## Network Metrics

1. **Centrality Measures**:
   - Degree centrality
   - Betweenness centrality
   - Closeness centrality
   - Eigenvector centrality
