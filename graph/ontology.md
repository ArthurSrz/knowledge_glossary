Like taxonomies, ontologies are classification schemes that describe the categories in a domain and the relationships between them. But ontologies are not restricted to hierarchical structures, so they can offer richer associativity. 

They also allow you to define hierarchies of relationships and to characterize those relationships in more nuanced ways (transitive, symmetric and so on.)
