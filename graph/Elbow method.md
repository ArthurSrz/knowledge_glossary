he Elbow Method is a [[Heuristics]] used to determine the optimal number of clusters in [[K-Means Clustering]]. It involves plotting the sum of squared distances (SSD) of each point to its assigned cluster center against the number of clusters (i.e, the model [[Inertia]]). The goal is to find the point at which the curve begins to level off, forming an "elbow," as this indicates that adding more clusters will not significantly improve the accuracy of the clustering. The optimal number of clusters is typically chosen based on this point.

To use the Elbow Method, follow these steps:

1. Choose a range of possible values for K (the number of clusters).
2. For each value of K, run K-means clustering and calculate the SSD.
3. Plot the SSD against the number of clusters.
4. Look for the point at which the curve begins to level off, forming an "elbow."
5. Choose the number of clusters corresponding to this point as the optimal number of clusters.

By using the Elbow Method, you can ensure that you are choosing the optimal number of clusters for your K-means clustering, which will result in more accurate and meaningful clusters.
