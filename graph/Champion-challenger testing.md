One way to do machine learning model [[Evaluation]]. 

It involves testing a new version of a machine learning model (the challenger) against an existing, high performing model (the champion). 

> [!info] Example 
>
> In 2018, Netflix introduced a new machine learning model for predicting user preferences and making personalized content recommendations called the **Deep Learning Recommender (DLR)**. This new model was tested against the existing model, called the **Collaborative Filtering (CF)** model, using Champion-challenger testing. 
> The CF model had been performing well, so it was the champion in this case. Netflix randomly assigned users to either the CF or DLR model and monitored various metrics, such as user engagement and content consumption. 
> After a few weeks, Netflix analyzed the results and found that the DLR model outperformed the CF model in terms of user engagement and content consumption. Based on these results, Netflix decided to roll out the DLR model as the default recommendation engine, which led to a significant improvement in user satisfaction and retention.
