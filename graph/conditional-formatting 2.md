## Conditional Formatting

| [[Feature]] | [[Excel]] | Google Sheets | Converts? |
|---------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Highlight cell [[rules]] | ✓ | ✓ | Partially — formula references may shift |
| Top/Bottom [[rules]] | ✓ | ✓ | Partially |
| [[Data]] bars | ✓ | ✗ | No — silently dropped |
| Icon sets | ✓ | ✗ | No — silently dropped |
| Color scales | ✓ | ✓ | Partially — theme colors shift |
| Custom formula [[rules]] | ✓ | ✓ | Partially — cell references don't always remap correctly |

Rule execution order and precedence differ between platforms. The "stop if true" logic in [[Excel]] has no direct equivalent in Sheets.

## Theme Colors

[[Excel]] uses a [[theme color]] system with tint/shade modifiers. Google Sheets has a simpler color [[model]]. When converting:

- Theme-referenced colors change unpredictably
- Tinted colors (e.g., "Accent 1, Lighter 40%") become fixed RGB values
- Round-trip loses the theme reference — the color value may survive but it's no longer theme-linked

## Fonts

- Platform-specific fonts (Calibri on Windows, Arial on Sheets) cause substitution
- Font rendering [[differences]] change column widths and row heights
- Vertical alignment may shift

## Charts

| [[Feature]] | Converts? |
|---------|-----------|
| Basic charts (bar, line, pie) | Mostly yes |
| 3D effects, shadows | Lost |
| Custom [[data]] labels | Lost or simplified |
| Secondary axes | May not transfer |
| Advanced formatting | Lost |

## Sparklines

**Fundamentally incompatible.** No conversion in either direction.

- **Google Sheets**: `=SPARKLINE(data, options)` — a formula in a cell
- **[[Excel]]**: Ribbon-inserted [[sparkline]] objects stored as sheet-level [[metadata]]

There is no [[mapping]] between these representations.
