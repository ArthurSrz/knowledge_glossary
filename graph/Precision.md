Of **all** the predicted positives, how many were actually positives. Ratio of [[True Positive (TP)]] divided by the sum of [[True Positive (TP)]] and [[False positives]]. 

Optimizing precision means making sure we get the right answers even if it involves leaving out a few right answers. We minimize the number of wrong answers. 

During the [[Evaluation]] phase of the [[CRISP-DM Process]], there is a tradeoff between the precision and the [[Accuracy]]

Statisticians prefer the term [[Variance]].
