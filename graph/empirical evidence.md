**Empirical evidence** is [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence "Evidence") obtained through [sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense "Sense") experience or [experimental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment "Experiment") procedure. It is of central importance to the [sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") and plays a role in various other fields, like [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology") and [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law").

There is no general agreement on how the terms _evidence_ and _empirical_ are to be defined. Often different fields work with quite different conceptions. In epistemology, evidence is what [justifies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justification_\(epistemology\) "Justification (epistemology)") [beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beliefs "Beliefs") or what determines whether holding a certain belief is [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational "Rational"). This is only possible if the evidence is possessed by the person, which has prompted various epistemologists to conceive evidence as private mental states like experiences or other beliefs. In [philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science "Philosophy of science"), on the other hand, evidence is understood as that which _[confirms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#Confirmation "Scientific method")_ or _disconfirms_ [scientific hypotheses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis#Scientific_hypothesis "Hypothesis") and arbitrates between competing theories. For this role, evidence must be public and uncontroversial, like observable physical objects or events and unlike private mental states, so that evidence may foster [scientific consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus "Scientific consensus"). The term **empirical** comes from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") ἐμπειρία _empeiría_, i.e. 'experience'. In this context, it is usually understood as what is observable, in contrast to unobservable or theoretical objects. It is generally accepted that unaided perception constitutes observation, but it is disputed to what extent objects accessible only to aided perception, like [bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria "Bacteria") seen through a microscope or positrons detected in a cloud chamber, should be regarded as observable.

Empirical evidence is essential to _[a posteriori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori "A priori and a posteriori")_ knowledge or **empirical knowledge**, [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge") whose [justification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justification_\(epistemology\) "Justification (epistemology)") or [falsification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability "Falsifiability") depends on experience or experiment. _A priori_ knowledge, on the other hand, is seen either as innate or as justified by rational intuition and therefore as not dependent on empirical evidence. [Rationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism "Rationalism") fully accepts that there is knowledge _a priori_, which is either outright rejected by [empiricism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism "Empiricism") or accepted only in a restricted way as knowledge of relations between our concepts but not as pertaining to the external world.

[Scientific evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_evidence "Scientific evidence") is closely related to empirical evidence but not all forms of empirical evidence meet the standards dictated by [scientific methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method"). Sources of empirical evidence are sometimes divided into [observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation "Observation") and [experimentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimentation "Experimentation"), the difference being that only experimentation involves manipulation or intervention: phenomena are actively created instead of being passively observed.

The concept of evidence is of central importance in [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology") and in [philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science "Philosophy of science") but plays different roles in these two fields. In epistemology, evidence is what [justifies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justification_\(epistemology\) "Justification (epistemology)") [beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beliefs "Beliefs") or what determines whether holding a certain [doxastic attitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxastic_attitude "Doxastic attitude") is [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational "Rational"). For example, the olfactory experience of smelling smoke justifies or makes it rational to hold the belief that something is burning. It is usually held that for justification to work, the evidence has to be possessed by the believer. The most straightforward way to account for this type of evidence possession is to hold that evidence consists of the private mental states possessed by the believer.[[6]](#cite_note-Conee-6)[[7]](#cite_note-philpapers.org-7)

Some philosophers restrict evidence even further, for example, to only conscious, propositional or factive mental states. Restricting evidence to conscious mental states has the implausible consequence that many simple everyday beliefs would be unjustified. This is why it is more common to hold that all kinds of mental states, including stored but currently unconscious beliefs, can act as evidence. Various of the roles played by evidence in reasoning, for example, in explanatory, probabilistic and deductive reasoning, suggest that evidence has to be propositional in nature, i.e. that it is correctly expressed by [propositional attitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_attitude "Propositional attitude") verbs like "believe" together with a that-clause, like "that something is burning". But it runs counter to the common practice of treating non-propositional sense-experiences, like bodily pains, as evidence. Its defenders sometimes combine it with the view that evidence has to be factive, i.e. that only attitudes towards true propositions constitute evidence. In this view, there is no misleading evidence. The olfactory experience of smoke would count as evidence if it was produced by a fire but not if it was produced by a smoke generator. This position has problems in explaining why it is still rational for the subject to believe that there is a fire even though the olfactory experience cannot be considered evidence.

In philosophy of science, evidence is understood as that which _[confirms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#Confirmation "Scientific method")_ or _disconfirms_ [scientific hypotheses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis#Scientific_hypothesis "Hypothesis") and arbitrates between competing theories. Measurements of Mercury's "anomalous" orbit, for example, constitute evidence that plays the role of _neutral arbiter_ between Newton's and Einstein's theory of gravitation by confirming Einstein's theory. For scientific consensus, it is central that evidence is public and uncontroversial, like observable physical objects or events and unlike private mental states. This way it can act as a shared ground for proponents of competing theories. Two issues threatening this role are the [problem of underdetermination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdetermination "Underdetermination") and [theory-ladenness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory-ladenness "Theory-ladenness"). The problem of underdetermination concerns the fact that the available evidence often provides equal support to either theory and therefore cannot arbitrate between them. Theory-ladenness refers to the idea that evidence already includes theoretical assumptions. These assumptions can hinder it from acting as neutral arbiter. It can also lead to a lack of shared evidence if different scientists do not share these assumptions. [Thomas Kuhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn "Thomas Kuhn") is an important advocate of the position that theory-ladenness concerning scientific paradigms plays a central role in science.

A thing is _evidence_ for a [proposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition "Proposition") if it epistemically supports this proposition or indicates that the supported proposition is true. Evidence is _empirical_ if it is constituted by or accessible to sensory experience. There are various competing theories about the exact definition of the terms _evidence_ and _empirical_. Different fields, like epistemology, the sciences or legal systems, often associate different concepts with these terms. An important distinction among theories of evidence is whether they identify evidence with private [mental states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_states "Mental states") or with public physical objects. Concerning the term _empirical_, there is a dispute about where to draw the line between observable or empirical objects in contrast to unobservable or merely theoretical objects.

The traditional view proposes that evidence is empirical if it is constituted by or accessible to sensory experience. This involves experiences arising from the stimulation of the sense organs, like visual or auditory experiences, but the term is often used in a wider sense including memories and introspection.It is usually seen as excluding purely intellectual experiences, like rational insights or intuitions used to justify basic logical or mathematical principles. The terms _empirical_ and _[observable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation "Observation")_ are closely related and sometimes used as synonyms.

There is an active debate in contemporary philosophy of science as to what should be regarded as observable or empirical in contrast to [unobservable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobservable "Unobservable") or merely theoretical objects. There is general consensus that everyday objects like books or houses are observable since they are accessible via unaided perception, but disagreement starts for objects that are only accessible through aided perception. This includes using telescopes to study distant galaxies, microscopes to study bacteria or using cloud chambers to study positrons. So the question is whether distant galaxies, bacteria or positrons should be regarded as observable or merely theoretical objects. Some even hold that any measurement process of an entity should be considered an observation of this entity. In this sense, the interior of the Sun is observable since neutrinos originating there can be detected. The difficulty with this debate is that there is a continuity of cases going from looking at something with the naked eye, through a window, through a pair of glasses, through a microscope, etc. Because of this continuity, drawing the line between any two adjacent cases seems to be arbitrary. One way to avoid these difficulties is to hold that it is a mistake to identify the empirical with what is observable or sensible. Instead, it has been suggested that empirical evidence can include unobservable entities as long as they are detectable through suitable measurements. A problem with this approach is that it is rather far from the original meaning of "empirical", which contains the reference to experience.
