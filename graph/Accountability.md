# Accountability

Based on Bamberger & Mulligan (2011), accountability in the context of AI and data systems refers to "the obligation of an organization to explain and justify its conduct to stakeholders." In their seminal work, they define it as encompassing three core elements:

1. **Answerability**: The duty to provide information about actions and decisions
2. **Responsibility**: The acknowledgment of being the cause of consequences
3. **Liability**: The acceptance of sanctions for failures or harms

Bovens (2007) in "Analysing and Assessing Accountability" further refined this as "a relationship between an actor and a forum, in which the actor has an obligation to explain and justify his or her conduct, the forum can pose questions and pass judgment, and the actor may face consequences."

In the context of AI systems, accountability ensures that organizations developing or deploying AI technologies can be held responsible for their actions and impacts.
