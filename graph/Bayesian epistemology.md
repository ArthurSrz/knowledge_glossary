[Bayesian epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_epistemology)

Bayesian epistemology is a formal approach to various topics in epistemology that has its roots in Thomas Bayes' work in the field of probability theory. One advantage of its formal method in contrast to traditional epistemology is that its concepts and theorems can be defined with a high degree of precision. **It is based on the idea that beliefs can be interpreted as subjective probabilities.** As such, they are subject to the laws of probability theory, which act as the norms of rationality. These norms can be divided into static constraints, governing the rationality of beliefs at any moment, and dynamic constraints, **governing how rational agents should change their beliefs upon receiving new evidence.**
