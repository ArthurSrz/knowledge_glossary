## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Launch the Application
```bash
# Use the launcher script
python launch_hoprag.py

# Or run directly
streamlit run hoprag_streamlit_app.py
```

### 3. Access the Application
Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8501`

## üìä System Overview

### Knowledge Graph Structure
- **Nodes**: AI/ML concepts from your markdown files
- **Edges**: Relationships extracted from content

## üéØ Example Queries

### Basic Queries
- "What is machine learning?"
- "How does bias affect AI fairness?"
- "What are privacy concerns in ML?"

### Multi-hop Reasoning Queries
- "What is the relationship between data governance and AI ethics?"
- "How do privacy regulations impact machine learning deployment?"
- "What are the connections between AutoML and model interpretability?"

### Complex Knowledge-Intensive Queries
- "How can I implement a privacy-preserving machine learning system that addresses both technical and regulatory requirements?"
- "What are the key considerations for deploying AI systems in healthcare while maintaining patient privacy and ensuring fairness?"

## üîç Understanding Results

### Answer Components
- **Main Answer**: Direct response to your question
- **Confidence Score**: System confidence in the answer
- **Reasoning Paths**: Step-by-step reasoning chains
- **Supporting Evidence**: Source material from knowledge graph

### Visualization Elements

- Report generation
- Analysis preservation

## üì§ Export Options

### Available Formats
- **JSON**: Structured data export
- **CSV**: Tabular path analysis
- **Markdown**: Human-readable reports
- **PDF**: Formatted reports (planned)

### Export Contents
- Query and timestamp
- Answer with confidence
- All reasoning paths

- System metadata

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Concepts
1. Add markdown files to the `graph/` directory
2. Use `[[concept_name]]` links for relationships
3. Restart the application to reload

### Modifying Reasoning
- Adjust path scoring algorithms
- Modify entity extraction methods
- Customize visualization layouts

### Integration Options
- Connect to external knowledge bases
