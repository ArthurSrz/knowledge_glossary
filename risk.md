In any data or ML projects, there is a risk that the project does not work as plan, because of the multi factor implied and that need to work together : 

1. Right skills
2. Right coordination of many expertise among the following : [[Data engineer]], [[Data scientist]], [[DevOps]], [[MLOps]]
3. Right infrastructure (enough [[Graphics processing unit]] or [[Central processing unit]])

Risk is rewarded by money (at organizational scale) and by [[excitement]].
