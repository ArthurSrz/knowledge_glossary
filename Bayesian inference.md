Bayesian inference is a method of [statistical inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference "Statistical inference") in which [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem "Bayes' theorem") is used to calculate a probability of a hypothesis, given prior [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence "Evidence"), and update it as more [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information "Information") becomes available. Fundamentally, Bayesian inference uses a [prior distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability "Prior probability") to estimate [posterior probabilities.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_probability "Posterior probability") Bayesian inference is an important technique in [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), and especially in [mathematical statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_statistics "Mathematical statistics"). Bayesian updating is particularly important in the [dynamic analysis of a sequence of data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_analysis "Sequential analysis"). Bayesian inference has found application in a wide range of activities, including [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine "Medicine"), [sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport "Sport"), and [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law"). In the philosophy of [decision theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory "Decision theory"), Bayesian inference is closely related to subjective probability, often called "[Bayesian probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability "Bayesian probability")".
