We collect past [[Observations]], and associate [[Features]], and define a [[Target]]. The model relate the 3. When we train, we identify the optimal parameters in the equation or set of equations. 

We start by selecting [[Features]]. Then we choose a template, the [[Algorithm]]. We tune the template with [[Hyperparameters]]. And we use the [[Loss function]] to evaluate the performance or our model. 

Breaks down into 2 steps : [[Model selection]] and [[Model tuning]]
