One interesting question is : 

> How many false positives can we expect from a AI detection tool given its [[Precision]], [[Accuracy]] and [[Recall]] measures ? 

And an even more fascinating question : 

> What the [[graph/Bayes' theorem|Bayes' theorem]] have to do with that ? 

Leading a a deep and very profund question : 

> Why is it that that we can determine P(A|B) from P(B|A) ? Meaning, in my case that we can determine the **probability** that a person indeed used AI to produce content (A) given it used a certain AI detection tool (B), from the known probability that
