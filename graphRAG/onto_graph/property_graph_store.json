\"[[Transparency 1]]\"\n---\nLocal Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) is a method developed to enhance the explainability and transparency of machine learning models, particularly those that are complex and difficult to interpret. It is designed to provide clear, localized explanations for individual predictions made by any type of machine learning model, whether it's a classifier, regressor, or neural network.\n\nThe core idea of LIME is to approximate the behavior of a complex model with a simpler, more interpretable model in the context of a specific prediction. To achieve this, LIME perturbs the input data by making small adjustments to the input features and observes how these changes influence the model’s predictions. The perturbed inputs, along with their corresponding outputs, form a dataset that is used to build a surrogate model.  \n \n\nThis surrogate model, which is typically a simpler model such as linear regression or a decision tree, is trained to focus on the region around the specific instance of interest by weighting data points based on their proximity to the original input. This localized approach allows LIME to accurately capture the decision-making process of the original model in that specific context.  \n \n\nBy analyzing the surrogate model, LIME identifies which features were most influential in the original model's prediction, providing a clear and interpretable explanation. This makes LIME a powerful tool for enhancing the transparency of machine learning models, enabling stakeholders to understand and trust the decisions made by these models, especially in critical

theory** is a field of control engineering and applied mathematics that deals with the control of dynamical systems in engineered processes and machines. The objective is to develop a model or algorithm governing the application of system inputs to drive the system to a desired state, while minimizing any _delay_, _overshoot_, or _steady-state error_ and ensuring a level of control stability; often with the aim to achieve a degree of optimality.\n\nTo do this, a **controller** with the requisite corrective behavior is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares it with the reference or set point \"Setpoint (control system)\") (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the _error_ signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are controllability and observability. Control theory is used in control system engineering to design automation that have revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries, and created new fields such as robotics.\n\nExtensive use is usually made of a diagrammatic style known as the block diagram.

and closed-loop (feedback) control\n\n\n\nFundamentally, there are two types of control loop: _open-loop control_ (feedforward), and _closed-loop control_ (feedback).\n\n- In open-loop control, the control action from the controller is independent of the \"process output\" (or \"controlled process variable\"). A good example of this is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer, so that heat is applied for a constant time, regardless of the temperature of the building. The control action is the switching on/off of the boiler, but the controlled variable should be the building temperature, but is not because this is open-loop control of the boiler, which does not give closed-loop control of the temperature.\n- In closed loop control, the control action from the controller is dependent on the process output. In the case of the boiler analogy, this would include a thermostat to monitor the building temperature, and thereby feed back a signal to ensure the controller maintains the building at the temperature set on the thermostat. A closed loop controller therefore has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to give a process output the same as the \"reference input\" or \"set point\".

design decisions : \n\n* cloud  VS. edge based \n* offline VS. online learning \n* batch VS.online predictions \n\nModern machine learning systems span a spectrum of deployment options, each with its own set of characteristics and use cases. At one end, we have cloud-based ML, which leverages powerful centralized computing resources for complex, data-intensive tasks. Moving along the spectrum, we encounter edge ML, which brings computation closer to the data source for reduced latency and improved privacy. Mobile ML further extends these capabilities to smartphones and tablets, while at the far end, we find Tiny ML, which enables machine learning on extremely low-power devices with severe memory and processing constraints.\n\nThis spectrum of deployment can be visualized like Earth’s geological features, each operating at different scales in our computational landscape. Cloud ML systems operate like continents, processing vast amounts of data across interconnected centers; Edge ML exists where these continental powers meet the sea, creating dynamic coastlines where computation flows into local waters; Mobile ML moves through these waters like ocean currents, carrying computing power across the digital seas; and where these currents meet the physical world, TinyML systems rise like islands, each a precise point of intelligence in the vast computational ocean.\n\nFigure 2.1 illustrates the spectrum of distributed intelligence across these approaches, providing a visual comparison of their characteristics. We will examine the unique characteristics, advantages, and challenges of each approach, as depicted in the figure. Additionally, we will discuss the emerging trends and technologies that are shaping the future of machine learning deployment, considering how they might influence the balance between these three paradigms.\n\n![](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/ml_systems/images/png/cloud-edge-tiny.png \"Figure 2.1: Cloud vs. Edge vs. Mobile vs. Tiny ML: The Spectrum of Distributed Intelligence.

evolution of machine learning systems can be seen as a progression from centralized to increasingly distributed and specialized computing paradigms:\n\n**Cloud ML**: Initially, ML was predominantly cloud-based. Powerful, scalable servers in data centers are used to train and run large ML models. This approach leverages vast computational resources and storage capacities, enabling the development of complex models trained on massive datasets. Cloud ML excels at tasks requiring extensive processing power, distributed training of large models, and is ideal for applications where real-time responsiveness isn’t critical. Popular platforms like AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI, and Azure ML offer flexible, scalable solutions for model development, training, and deployment. Cloud ML can handle models with billions of parameters, training on petabytes of data, but may incur latencies of 100-500 ms for online inference due to network delays.\n\n**Edge ML**: As the need for real-time, low-latency processing grew, Edge ML emerged. This paradigm brings inference capabilities closer to the data source, typically on edge devices such as industrial gateways, smart cameras, autonomous vehicles, or IoT hubs. Edge ML reduces latency (often to less than 50 ms), enhances privacy by keeping data local, and can operate with intermittent cloud connectivity. It’s particularly useful for applications requiring quick responses or handling sensitive data in industrial or enterprise settings. Frameworks like NVIDIA Jetson or Google’s Edge TPU enable powerful ML capabilities on edge devices. Edge ML plays a crucial role in IoT ecosystems, enabling real-time decision making and reducing bandwidth usage by processing data locally.\n\n**Mobile ML**: Building on edge computing concepts, Mobile ML focuses on leveraging the computational capabilities of smartphones and tablets. This approach enables personalized, responsive applications while reducing reliance on constant network connectivity. Mobile ML offers a balance between the power of edge computing and the ubiquity of personal devices. It utilizes on-device sensors (e.g., cameras, GPS, accelerometers) for unique ML applications. Frameworks like TensorFlow Lite and Core ML allow developers to deploy optimized models on mobile devices, with inference times often under 30 ms for common tasks. Mobile ML enhances privacy by keeping personal data on the device and can operate offline, but must balance model performance with device resource constraints (typically 4-8 GB RAM, 100-200 GB storage).\n\n**Tiny ML**: The latest development in this progression is Tiny ML, which enables ML models to run on extremely resource-constrained microcontrollers and small embedded

ML**: Building on edge computing concepts, Mobile ML focuses on leveraging the computational capabilities of smartphones and tablets. This approach enables personalized, responsive applications while reducing reliance on constant network connectivity. Mobile ML offers a balance between the power of edge computing and the ubiquity of personal devices. It utilizes on-device sensors (e.g., cameras, GPS, accelerometers) for unique ML applications. Frameworks like TensorFlow Lite and Core ML allow developers to deploy optimized models on mobile devices, with inference times often under 30 ms for common tasks. Mobile ML enhances privacy by keeping personal data on the device and can operate offline, but must balance model performance with device resource constraints (typically 4-8 GB RAM, 100-200 GB storage).\n\n**Tiny ML**: The latest development in this progression is Tiny ML, which enables ML models to run on extremely resource-constrained microcontrollers and small embedded systems. Tiny ML allows for on-device inference without relying on connectivity to the cloud, edge, or even the processing power of mobile devices. This approach is crucial for applications where size, power consumption, and cost are critical factors. Tiny ML devices typically operate with less than 1 MB of RAM and flash memory, consuming only milliwatts of power, enabling battery life of months or years. Applications include wake word detection, gesture recognition, and predictive maintenance in industrial settings. Platforms like Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and STM32 microcontrollers, coupled with frameworks like TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers, enable ML on these tiny devices. However, Tiny ML requires significant model optimization and quantization1 to fit within these constraints.\n\n1 **Quantization**: Process of reducing the numerical precision of ML model parameters to reduce memory footprint and computational demand.\n\nEach of these paradigms has its own strengths and is suited to different use cases:\n\n- Cloud ML remains essential for tasks requiring massive computational power or large-scale data analysis.\n- Edge ML is ideal for applications needing low-latency responses or local data processing in industrial or enterprise environments.\n- Mobile ML is

like Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and STM32 microcontrollers, coupled with frameworks like TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers, enable ML on these tiny devices. However, Tiny ML requires significant model optimization and quantization1 to fit within these constraints.\n\n1 **Quantization**: Process of reducing the numerical precision of ML model parameters to reduce memory footprint and computational demand.\n\nEach of these paradigms has its own strengths and is suited to different use cases:\n\n- Cloud ML remains essential for tasks requiring massive computational power or large-scale data analysis.\n- Edge ML is ideal for applications needing low-latency responses or local data processing in industrial or enterprise environments.\n- Mobile ML is suited for personalized, responsive applications on smartphones and tablets.\n- Tiny ML enables AI capabilities in small, power-efficient devices, expanding the reach of ML to new domains.\n\nThis progression reflects a broader trend in computing towards more distributed, localized, and specialized processing. The evolution is driven by the need for faster response times, improved privacy, reduced bandwidth usage, and the ability to operate in environments with limited or no connectivity, while also catering to the specific capabilities and constraints of different types of devices.\n\nFigure 2.2 illustrates the key differences between Cloud ML, Edge ML, Mobile ML, and Tiny ML in terms of hardware, latency, connectivity, power requirements, and model complexity. As we move from Cloud to Edge to Tiny ML, we see a dramatic reduction in available resources, which presents significant challenges for deploying sophisticated machine learning models. This resource disparity becomes particularly apparent when attempting to deploy deep learning models on microcontrollers, the primary hardware platform for Tiny ML. These tiny devices have severely constrained memory and storage capacities, which are often insufficient for conventional deep learning models. We will learn to put these things into perspective in this chapter.\n\n![](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/ml_systems/images/jpg/cloud_mobile_tiny_sizes.jpg \"Figure 2.2: From cloud GPUs to microcontrollers: Navigating the memory and storage landscape across computing devices.

\"[[control theory 1]]\"\n---\n\n**Systems theory** is the transdisciplinary1(#cite_note-1) study of systems, i.e. cohesive groups of interrelated, interdependent components that can be natural or artificial. Every system has causal boundaries, is influenced by its context, defined by its structure, function and role, and expressed through its relations with other systems. A system is \"more than the sum of its parts\" when it expresses synergy or emergent behavior.2(#cite_note-2)\n\nChanging one component of a system may affect other components or the whole system. It may be possible to predict these changes in patterns of behavior. For systems that learn and adapt, the growth and the degree of adaptation depend upon how well the system is engaged with its environment and other contexts influencing its organization. Some systems support other systems, maintaining the other system to prevent failure. The goals of systems theory are to model a system's dynamics, constraints, conditions, and relations; and to elucidate principles (such as purpose, measure, methods, tools) that can be discerned and applied to other systems at every level of nesting, and in a wide range of fields for achieving optimized equifinality.3(#cite_note-3)\n\nGeneral systems theory is about developing broadly applicable concepts and principles, as opposed to concepts and principles specific to one domain of knowledge. It distinguishes dynamic or active systems from static or passive systems. Active systems are activity structures or components that interact in behaviours and processes or interrelate through formal contextual boundary conditions (attractors). Passive systems are structures and components that are being processed.

Happens when the patterns that the model learned no longer apply. \n\nExample : in fraud detection, the purchase of one-way tickets was a potential sign of fraud, but with COVID, the pattern no longer applied. \n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nIn predictive analytics, data science, machine learning and related fields, **concept drift** or **drift** is an evolution of data that invalidates the data model. It happens when the statistical properties of the target variable, which the model is trying to predict, change over time in unforeseen ways.

configuration decay\n\n\nAnother important area is software engineering, where three types of data drift affecting data fidelity may be recognized. Changes in the software environment (\"infrastructure drift\") may invalidate software infrastructure configuration. \"Structural drift\" happens when the data schema changes, which may invalidate databases. \"Semantic drift\" is changes in the meaning of data while the structure does not change. In many cases this may happen in complicated applications when many independent developers introduce changes without proper awareness of the effects of their changes in other areas of the software system.\n\nFor many application systems, the nature of data on which they operate are subject to changes for various reasons, e.g., due to changes in business model, system updates, or switching the platform on which the system operates.\n\nIn the case of cloud computing, infrastructure drift that may affect the applications running on cloud may be caused by the updates of cloud software.\n\nThere are several types of detrimental effects of data drift on data fidelity. Data corrosion is passing the drifted data into the system undetected. Data loss happens when valid data are ignored due to non-conformance with the applied schema. Squandering is the phenomenon when new data fields are introduced upstream the data processing pipeline, but somewhere downstream there data fields are absent.\n\n\"Data drift\" may refer to the phenomenon when database records fail to match the real-world data due to the changes in the latter over time. This is a common problem with databases involving people, such as customers, employees, citizens, residents, etc. Human data drift may be caused by unrecorded changes in personal data, such as place of residence or name, as well as due to errors during data input.\n\n\"Data drift\" may also refer to inconsistency of data elements between several replicas of a database. The reasons can be difficult to identify. A simple drift detection is to run checksum regularly. However the remedy may be not so easy.\n\nThe behavior of the customers in an online shop may change over time. For example, if weekly merchandise sales are to be predicted, and a predictive model has been developed that works satisfactorily. The model may use inputs such as the amount of money spent on advertising, promotions \"Promotion (marketing)\") being run, and other metrics that may affect sales.

is a common problem with databases involving people, such as customers, employees, citizens, residents, etc. Human data drift may be caused by unrecorded changes in personal data, such as place of residence or name, as well as due to errors during data input.\n\n\"Data drift\" may also refer to inconsistency of data elements between several replicas of a database. The reasons can be difficult to identify. A simple drift detection is to run checksum regularly. However the remedy may be not so easy.\n\nThe behavior of the customers in an online shop may change over time. For example, if weekly merchandise sales are to be predicted, and a predictive model has been developed that works satisfactorily. The model may use inputs such as the amount of money spent on advertising, promotions \"Promotion (marketing)\") being run, and other metrics that may affect sales. The model is likely to become less and less accurate over time – this is concept drift. In the merchandise sales application, one reason for concept drift may be seasonality, which means that shopping behavior changes seasonally. Perhaps there will be higher sales in the winter holiday season than during the summer, for example. Concept drift generally occurs when the covariates that comprise the data set begin to explain the variation of your target set less accurately — there may be some confounding variables that have emerged, and that one simply cannot account for, which renders the model accuracy to progressively decrease with time. Generally, it is advised to perform health checks as part of the post-production analysis and to re-train the model with new assumptions upon signs of concept drift.\n\nTo prevent deterioration in prediction accuracy because of concept drift, _reactive_ and _tracking_ solutions can be adopted. Reactive solutions retrain the model in reaction to a triggering mechanism, such as a change-detection test, to explicitly detect concept drift as a change in the statistics of the data-generating process. When concept drift is detected, the current model is no longer up-to-date and must be replaced by a new one to restore prediction accuracy. A shortcoming of reactive approaches is that performance may decay until the change is detected. Tracking solutions seek to track the changes in the concept by continually updating the model. Methods for achieving this include online machine learning, frequent retraining on the most recently observed samples, and maintaining an ensemble of classifiers where one new classifier is trained on

prevent deterioration in prediction accuracy because of concept drift, _reactive_ and _tracking_ solutions can be adopted. Reactive solutions retrain the model in reaction to a triggering mechanism, such as a change-detection test, to explicitly detect concept drift as a change in the statistics of the data-generating process. When concept drift is detected, the current model is no longer up-to-date and must be replaced by a new one to restore prediction accuracy. A shortcoming of reactive approaches is that performance may decay until the change is detected. Tracking solutions seek to track the changes in the concept by continually updating the model. Methods for achieving this include online machine learning, frequent retraining on the most recently observed samples, and maintaining an ensemble of classifiers where one new classifier is trained on the most recent batch of examples and replaces the oldest classifier in the ensemble.\n\nContextual information, when available, can be used to better explain the causes of the concept drift: for instance, in the sales prediction application, concept drift might be compensated by adding information about the season to the model. By providing information about the time of the year, the rate of deterioration of your model is likely to decrease, but concept drift is unlikely to be eliminated altogether. This is because actual shopping behavior does not follow any static, finite model. New factors may arise at any time that influence shopping behavior, the influence of the known factors or their interactions may change.\n\nConcept drift cannot be avoided for complex phenomena that are not governed by fixed laws of nature. All processes that arise from human activity, such as socioeconomic processes, and biological processes are likely to experience concept drift.

SHAP calcule une valeur qui représente la contribution de chaque caractéristique au résultat du modèle. Ces valeurs peuvent être utilisées pour comprendre l’importance de chaque caractéristique et expliquer le résultat du modèle à un humain. Ceci apporte notamment une valeur ajoutée aux agences et aux équipes qui rendent des comptes à leurs clients ou leurs managers.\n\nSHAP possède plusieurs propriétés intéressantes, comme

SHAP est-il utile ?\n\nSHAP comporte de nombreuses utilités pour les professionnels de la Data Science. Tout d’abord, cette technique permet d’expliquer les prédictions des modèles de Machine Learning de manière compréhensible aux humains. **Grâce à l’attribution d’une valeur à chaque caractéristique entrée, il montre comment et dans quelle mesure chaque caractéristique a contribué au résultat final de la prédiction**. Ainsi, l’équipe peut comprendre comment le modèle a pris sa décision et peut identifier les caractéristiques les plus importantes.\n\nComme expliqué précédemment, ce modèle est dit agnostique (neutre). Il peut être utilisé avec n’importe quel modèle de Machine Learning. Vous n’avez donc pas à vous soucier de la structure du modèle pour comprendre le résultat de la **prédiction avec SHAP**. En plus, ce modèle est cohérent.
