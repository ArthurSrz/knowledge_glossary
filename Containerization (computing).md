[Containerization (computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization_(computing)): In software engineering, containerization is operating-systemâ€“level virtualization or application-level virtualization over multiple network resources so that software applications can run in isolated user spaces called containers in any cloud or non-cloud environment, regardless of type or vendor. The term "container" is overloaded, and it is important to ensure that the intended definition aligns with the audience's understanding.
