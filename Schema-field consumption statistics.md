Feature developed in [[Spotify story]] to help data scientist cold start using the data

> Datasets often contain dozens or even hundreds of schema fields. Once you’ve determined that you’ve found the right dataset, it can be quite daunting to try to understand all of the available fields and determine which ones are actually relevant. In addition to basic metadata about the schema fields, we included consumption statistics at the schema field level. This shows the number of queries referencing the schema field and the number of unique people who have queried the schema field. This feature gives Lexikon users a way to sort the list of available fields by usage to easily find the ones that are likely to be the most relevant.
